# Multimodal Telegram Message Analysis: An Exploratory Study

Does the subject of Telegram messages impact message views? In this study, I examined the impact of text and image content on message view counts for messages sent between 15 February 2022 and 15 March 2022 in a Telegram channel associated with the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM). My goal was to examine how multimodal computational tools, including computer vision, can be used to inductively explore online discourse associated with an extremist group.
